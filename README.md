# Ultimate Album

### Overview
This project investigates the greatest albums of all time, inspired by Apple Music's "100 Greatest Albums of All Time" and includes data from Rolling Stone's 2023 Top 500 Albums, Billboard's 2015 Top 200 Albums, Grammy Awards, and Spotify streams. It aims to uncover key insights such as:

•	Greatest albums featured across the three lists (Billboard, Rolling Stone, and Apple)

•	Decades with the highest number of albums 

•	Most popular genres represented in the lists.

•	Top artists featured (those with multiple albums).

•	Comparison of male and female artists on the lists.

•	Performance of older albums on Spotify streams compared to newer albums.

•	Analysis of albums on the lists in relation to Grammy awards.

An interactive Power BI dashboard has been created to facilitate a deeper exploration of these insights, providing a comprehensive understanding of the greatest albums of all time.
